\para{State machine replication.} TBD. General literature.

% Various paxos protocols. Ours is complementary. Can be plugged into our 
% system.

% Three systems aim to provide SMR services to server programs. Eve, Rex, Dare, 
% Crane.
% Type I: Dare. Weaker durability. Four RDMA writes. We have two RDMA writes 
% plus two SSD writes. Compatible perf. Not for general server programs.

% Type II: Eve, Rex, Crane. All slow. Eve has output check, but also slow, use 
% TCP, and needs annotation.


\para{RDMA techniques.} Othre RDMA applications. KV. Transactions 
(last SOSP).

\para{DMT.} Increasing assurance of replicas on thread schedulings. Not general 
as Falcon's checkpoint techniques. But complementary for example ClamAV.

\para{Concurrency.} Pervasive in real-world applications. Threads. Processes. 
Break SMR's state machine assumption. complementary.
