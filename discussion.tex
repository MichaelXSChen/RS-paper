\section{Discussions}\label{sec:discuss}

This section discusses \xxx's limitations (\S\ref{sec:limits}) and its broad 
applications (\S\ref{sec:apps}).

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec:limits}

% Have not hooked time and rand(). Can use PMP approach. Not a problem for 
% evaluated apps. 

% Clamav style.

% No guarantees on recovery. Best effort. But, can we actually server requests 
% one by one?

%% No lxc.


\subsection{Applications in Broad Research Areas}\label{sec:apps}

% Other replication topics.

% Parallel program analysis. Such a short coordination time can make replicas 
% run almost as fast as each other, support many time-critical analyses 
% such as race detection and security defenses.

% One idea: can leverage the checkpoint and rollback protocok, and the 
% consensus part, to build a system that can automatically bypass concurrency 
% bugs without fixing them. The way to bypass: proactively reordering socket 
% calls. Self-healing system.

% A core building block in future operating systems. Maintain a consistent view 
% of computing resources and data. Used in scheduling framework (Mesos) because 
% its latency is almost compatible with context switches of processes (sub 
% milli seconds).
