\section{Discussions}\label{sec:discuss}

This section discusses \xxx's limitations (\S\ref{sec:limits}) and its 
applications in other research areas (\S\ref{sec:apps}).

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec:limits}

% Input coordination protocol.

% Have not hooked time and rand(). Can use PMP approach. Not a problem for 
% evaluated apps. 
\xxx currently does not hook random functions such as \v{gettimeofday()} and 
\v{rand()} because our output checkers have not detected network output 
divergence comming from these functions. Existing 
approaches~\cite{eve:osdi12,paxos:practical} in \paxos protocols can be 
leveraged to intercept these functions and make them produce same results among 
replicas.

% Output checking protocol.

% Clamav style.
\xxx's output checking protocol may have false positives or false negatives, 
because it just makes an effort to practically indicate that replicas are 
running the same execution states. A server program running in \xxx may have 
false positive when it uses multiple threads to serve the same client 
connection and uses these threads to concurrently produce outputs 
(\eg, \clamav). Running a DMT scheduler in \xxx can address this problem. In 
our evaluation, all programs except \clamav uses only one thread to process one 
client connection and they don't have such false positives.

A server program may also have false negative when it triggers a software bug 
but the bug does not propogate to network outputs. On client programs' point of 
view, such bugs do not matter; \xxx already checkpoints file system state to 
mitigate this issue.

When execution divergence is detected in a replica, \xxx's rollback mechanism 
is not designed to guarantee that the re-executions of this replica will 
definitely avoids this divergence. We made this design choice because both 
our evaluation and a previous work Eve~\cite{eve:osdi12} found that divergence 
happens extremely rarely in evaluation. In our evaluation, we found that simply 
re-executing the log can practically make \xxx's replicas converge to 
same execution states. A similar finding is that although Eve provided a 
sequential re-execution approach to with divergence avoidance guarantee, which 
\xxx can leverage, but even Eve's evaluation didn't experience any divergence 
and thus this approach was not invoked.

% Read only opt?

% No guarantees on recovery. Best effort. But, can we actually server requests 
% one by one?

%% No lxc.

%% Support for Java may not be good due to the VM memory copying. Some 
% techniques that avoid memory copying may be usable~\cite{weixu:tsinghua}. Good 
% for % C/C++ programs as long as they use POSIX socket APIs.


\subsection{\xxx's Applications in Broad Areas}\label{sec:apps}

\xxx's a fast, general SMR service can be applied broadly, and 
here we elaborate three. First, \xxx's RDMA-accelerated \paxos protocol and its 
implementation could be an effective template for many other distributed 
protocols in datacenters. For instance, an immediate extension of \xxx is to 
make it tolerate byzantine faults. Another promising direction is three-phase 
commit (3PC): 3PC is often blamed by its intolerance on network partitions and 
asynchronour communications, and its high latency caused by the three 
round-trips. Fortunately, within the RDMA-enabled datacenter context, people may 
leverage \xxx's techniques and experience to build a significantly faster and 
more reliable 3PC protocols.

% Other replication topics.

% Parallel program analysis. Such a short coordination time can make replicas 
% run almost as fast as each other, support many time-critical analyses 
% such as race detection and security defenses.
Second, by efficiently constructing multiple, equivalent executions for the 
same program, \xxx can benefit distributed program analysis techniques. Bounded 
by the limited computing resources on single machine, recent advanced 
reliability and security analaysis frameworks are moving towards distributed in 
order to offload analyses on multiple machines. \xxx can be leveraged in these 
frameworks so that developers of analysis tools can just focus on their own 
analysis logic, while \xxx's general replication architecture efficiently 
handles the rest. Moreover, analyses developers can tightly integrate their 
tools with \xxx (\eg, they can proactively diversify the orders of socket 
calls in \xxx's consensus logs among replicas to improve replicas' tolerance on
security attacks).

% TBD: use \xxx to detect software bugs by checking outputs, even in 
% real-world deployments. XXX make program % inputs strongly consistent across 
% replicas, so output divergence are likely % from software bugs. XXX promising % 
% results in our evaluation. Find a bug in % ssdb?

% One idea: can leverage the checkpoint and rollback protocok, and the 
% consensus part, to build a system that can automatically bypass concurrency 
% bugs without fixing them. The way to bypass: proactively reordering socket 
% calls. Self-healing system.

% A core building block in future operating systems. Maintain a consistent view 
% of computing resources and data. Used in scheduling framework (Mesos) because 
% its latency is almost compatible with context switches of processes (sub 
% milli seconds).
Third, \xxx can be a core building block in the emerging datacenter operating 
systems~\cite{hotos15, mesos, web-article}. As a datacenter continuously 
emerges a computer, an OS may be increasingly needed for thus a giant 
computer. \xxx's fast, general coordination service is espeicially suitable 
for such an OS's scheduler to maintain a consistent, reliable view on both 
computing resources and data in a datacenter. For instance,, \xxx's latency is 
largely between 15 to 20 \us, much smaller than a typical context swtich of a 
process (typically, a few hundreds \us).
