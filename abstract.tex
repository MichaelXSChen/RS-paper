State machine replication (SMR) runs replicas of the same program and 
uses a distributed consensus protocol (\eg, \paxos) to enforce the same inputs 
among replicas, tolerating various faults. Although recent SMR systems have 
greatly improved the reliability of server programs, SMR remains difficult to 
deploy due to its high consensus latency. This paper presents \xxx, 
a fast SMR system by leveraging Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). \xxx 
intercepts inputs from a server program's socket calls and runs a new 
RDMA-accelerated \paxos protocol to coordinate these inputs among replicas. This 
protocol addresses a \paxos scalability challenge by tightly integrating RDMA 
features within the fault-tolerant nature of \paxos, making replicas reach 
consensus rapidly in parallel. Leveraging this protocol, \xxx presents a fast 
network output checking protocol to check whether replicas run in sync.

% \xxx addresses

% challenge, avoiding a server' execution state divergence in active replicas, by 
% presenting a fast, application-agnostic output checking mechanism on top of our 
% consensus protocol.
% go through software network layers and 
% to efficiently bypass these software layers
% We argue that these network layers are \emph{not} inherent to SMR 
% because consensus protocols can already tolerate various faults (\eg, crash in 
% the OS layer). 

Evaluation on \nprog widely used, diverse server programs (\eg, \memcached and 
\mysql) shows that \xxx is: (1) general, it ran these servers 
without modifications except one program; (2) fast, it incurred merely a 
\latencyoverhead mean overhead in response time and \tputoverhead in 
throughput, and its consensus latency was \fasterthanzookeeper faster than 
a prior SMR system built on \zookeeper; (3) scalable, it achieved similar 
consensus latency on a replica group size of three to seven; and (4) 
robust, its network output protocol efficiently detected and recovered replicas 
from divergence.

% Stat machine replication definition. Focus on networking part, 
% message passing, 
% traditional TCP/IP network. Attractive for general applications, especially 
% online services that put more and more data in memory for speed. Two challenge: 
% slow coordination; no systematic mechanism to practically enforce same 
% execution states among replicas. \xxx, efficient, application agonistic SMR 
% system. \xxx addresses the first challenge by leveraging RDMA to build an 
% speedy paxos protocol. \xxx leverages this protocol to efficiently detect 
% execution divergence that affect network outputs and perform roll back. 

% Evaluation highlights: (1) 10+ general applications, including key-value 
% stores, SQL servers, security servers, ldap servers, and multimedia servers, 
% efficient, little overhead. (2) recover from divergence caused by concurrency 
% bugs, while redis's replication system failed to detect the divergence. (3) 
% with X lines of modifications, faster than redis's own replication system by XX 
% times.
