% S1: SMR, reliable, good for online services, machines, network. 
% S2: but going through network round trips for requests hurt latency of 
% services.
% S3: Traditional network layers or OS are not inherent to consensus protocols 
% because these protocols have already considered exceptional cases such as 
% packet losses and kernel failures.
% S4: We can leverage RDMA (one side read/write).
% S5: \xxx, a speed input coordination protocol that levearages fastest RDMA 
% operations.
% \xxx addresses an important challenge that practically enforce execution 
% states on systems nondeterminism such as thread nondeternimism and systems 
% resources contentions.

% Stat machine replication definition. Focus on networking part, 
% message passing, 
% traditional TCP/IP network. Attractive for general applications, especially 
% online services that put more and more data in memory for speed. Two challenge: 
% slow coordination; no systematic mechanism to practically enforce same 
% execution states among replicas. \xxx, efficient, application agonistic SMR 
% system. \xxx addresses the first challenge by leveraging RDMA to build an 
% speedy paxos protocol. \xxx leverages this protocol to efficiently detect 
% execution divergence that affect network outputs and perform roll back. 

% Evaluation highlights: (1) 10+ general applications, including key-value 
% stores, SQL servers, security servers, ldap servers, and multimedia servers, 
% efficient, little overhead. (2) recover from divergence caused by concurrency 
% bugs, while redis's replication system failed to detect the divergence. (3) 
% with X lines of modifications, faster than redis's own replication system by XX 
% times.
