Stat machine replication definition. Focus on networking part, message passing, 
traditional TCP/IP network. Attractive for general applications, especially 
online services that put more and more data in memory for speed. Two challenge: 
slow coordination; no systematic mechanism to practically enforce same 
execution states among replicas. \xxx, efficient, application agonistic SMR 
system. \xxx addresses the first challenge by leveraging RDMA to build an 
speedy paxos protocol. \xxx leverages this protocol to efficiently detect 
execution divergence that affect network outputs and perform roll back. 

Evaluation highlights: (1) 10+ general applications, including key-value 
stores, SQL servers, security servers, ldap servers, and multimedia servers, 
efficient, little overhead. (2) recover from divergence caused by concurrency 
bugs, while redis's replication system failed to detect the divergence. (3) 
with X lines of modifications, faster than redis's own replication system by XX 
times.
