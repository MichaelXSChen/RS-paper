%P1: SMR difinition; traditional network message passing; reliable; attractive 
% for general servers.
SMR~\cite{crane:sosp15}. 

% P2: most servers lack such a service due to two challenges. First, two slow, 
% TCP/IP. Example, Calvin.

% P3: no systematic mechanism to automatically enforce execution states for 
% these servers. Current approach: (1) ping. (2) DMT, record replay. (3) 
% verification.

% P4: Falcon; key features.

% P5: Falcon: RDMA input coordination.

% P5.1: Support read-only optimization.

% P6: Falcon: output checker.

% P7: essense: complete architecture. agree-execute-enforcement.

% P8: implementation. support checkpoint.

% P9: Evaluatuion, with highlight items, match abstract, but more details.

% P10: Contribution.

% P11: Remaining of paper.
