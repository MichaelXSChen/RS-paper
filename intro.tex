% P1: Defintion of State machine replication (SMR) and its value on 
% fault-tolerance. Emphasis that SMR is especially useful to server
% applications that provide on-line service.

\emph{State machine replication (\smr)} models a program as a deterministic 
state machine, where the states are important program data and the transitions 
are deterministic executions of program code under input 
requests~\cite{crane:sosp15}.
