%P1: Concurrency bugs are harmful and pervasive. 
Driven by the rise of multi-core hardware, multithreaded programs have become
increasingly prevalent. However, despite much effort,
these programs are still notoriously difficult to get right. They are 
plagued with concurrency bugs (\ie, shared memory access among threads without 
proper synchronization). These bugs caused severe consequences such as 
memory corruption, wrong outputs, and program 
crashes~\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs}.
