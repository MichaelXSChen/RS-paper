\section{Output Checking Protocol} \label{sec:output}

% TBD.

\subsection{Checkpoint and Rollback} \label{sec:checkpoint}

% Strawmen approach? Necessary?

% Leverage the input protocol to carry the hash of outputs.

% When divergence is detected, spawn the mechanism, show workflow.

\subsection{Checkpoint and Rollback} \label{sec:checkpoint}

% TBD.

% Regularly: periodically checkpoint.

% Orthogonal to the \paxos protocol, just feel like some replicas restart 
% themselves. Paxos can handle this.

% Sound. As long as local machines have a checkpoint with a viewstamp before 
% the last matched output check.

% Efficient. Occasionally check hash.
