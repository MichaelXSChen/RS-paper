\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \xxx, a fast, scalalbe RDMA-based \paxos protocol with its 
runtime system. Evaluation on popular \paxos protocols and widely used server 
programs shows that \xxx is fast, scalable, and robust. \xxx has the potential 
to improve the consistency and fault-tolerance of various systems in 
datacenters. \xxx is deployable: all source code, benchmarks, and raw 
evaluation results are available at \github.
