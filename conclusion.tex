\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

% Software bugs in both sequential programs and concurrent programs can lead to 
% security attacks.

We have presented the first in-depth study on real-world concurrency attacks 
and \xxx, the first analysis framework to detect them. Our study reveals the 
diverse, severe threats of concurrency attacks and their common patterns. Our 
\xxx framework can accurately detect a number of known and previously unknown 
concurrency attacks on large, widely used programs, with reasonable time cost. 
We believe that our study will attract much attention to further detect 
and defend against concurrency attacks. Our \xxx framework has the potential to 
bridge the gap between concurrency bugs and the attacks they can lead to. All 
our study results, exploit scripts, and \xxx source code with raw evaluation 
results are available at \github.
