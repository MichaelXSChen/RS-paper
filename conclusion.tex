\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \xxx, a new RDMA-based \paxos protocol and its runtime 
system. Evaluation on 5 \paxos protocols and 9 widely used programs 
shows that \xxx is fast, scalable, and robust. It has the potential to improve 
the consistency and fault-tolerance of many systems in datacenters. \xxx is 
deployable: all source code, benchmarks, and raw evaluation results are 
available at \github.
