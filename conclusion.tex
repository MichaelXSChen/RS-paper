\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \xxx, a fast, general state machine replication system 
through building an RDMA-accelerated \paxos protocol to efficiently coordinate 
replica inputs. On top of this protocol, \xxx introduces an automated, 
efficient output checking protocol to detect and recover execution divergence 
among replicas and improve the assurance of sync in replicas. Evaluation on 
widely used, diverse server programs shows that \xxx supports these unmodified 
programs with reasonable performance overhead, and can recover from replica 
divergence caused by real-world software bugs. \xxx has the potential to 
greatly increase the adoption of state machine replication and improve the 
reliability of general programs.
