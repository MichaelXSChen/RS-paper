\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \xxx, a fast, general SMR system 
through building an RDMA-accelerated \paxos protocol to efficiently coordinate 
inputs. On top of this protocol, \xxx introduces an automated, efficient output 
checking protocol to detect and recover out divergence. Evaluation on widely 
used server programs shows that \xxx is fast, scalable, and robust. 
\xxx has the potential to promote the adoption of SMR and to improve 
the reliability of general programs.
