\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
% \vspace{-.05in}
We have presented \xxx, a new RDMA-based \paxos protocol and its runtime 
system. Evaluation on five consensus protocols and \nprog widely used programs 
shows that \xxx is fast, scalable, and deployable. It has the potential to 
greatly promote the deployments of \paxos and improve the reliability of 
real-world programs.
% \xxx is deployable: all 
% source code and raw evaluation results are 
% available at \github.
