\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \xxx, a new RDMA-based \paxos protocol with its runtime 
system. Evaluation on five \paxos protocols and widely used programs 
shows that \xxx is fast, scalable, and robust. It has the potential to improve 
the consistency and fault-tolerance of many systems in datacenters. \xxx is 
deployable: all source code, benchmarks, and raw evaluation results are 
available at \github.
